# Project Origin

Flowline is a clean-room, from-scratch implementation.

- No source code, documentation, or internal designs from prior employers were used.
- No proprietary protocols or internal architectures were reused.
- All contributors confirm that they contribute original work or properly licensed code.

The project is developed as an independent open-source initiative.
